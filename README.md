üìö My Advanced .NET E-Commerce Project üõí

Welcome to my GitHub repository for the Advanced Programming with .NET [C] course at AIUB University. As a student, I'm excited to share my progress and learning experiences with you through this project.

üåê About the Project:
This repository showcases my journey in building a fully-featured e-commerce application using ASP.NET Web Application (.NET Framework), Entity Framework, and Microsoft SQL. The project serves as part of my coursework, and I'm excited to share the steps I've taken to master various web development concepts.

üìã Key Tasks:
1. **Establish Database Relationships:**
   - I've learned how to define relationships and create a database between Products and Product Categories, ensuring data integrity and organization.

2. **CRUD Operations:**
   - Implementing Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations between Products and Categories, I've honed my programming skills and database management.

3. **User Login System:**
   - Developing a secure login system has been a significant achievement, focusing on user authentication and data privacy.

4. **Product Purchase Flow:**
   - Enabling users to add products to their cart and complete purchases has given me practical insights into building e-commerce platforms.

5. **Shopping Cart Management:**
   - I've created a user-friendly interface to add and view multiple products in the shopping cart.

6. **Order Placement:**
   - The order placement system, which records transactions in the database, showcases my progress in application development.

I'm excited to upload this project to GitHub to share my journey and the code I've written. Please keep in mind that this is a student project, and I welcome any feedback, suggestions, or contributions from the GitHub community.

Let's learn and grow together! Feel free to explore my code and project documentation. If you have any questions or ideas, don't hesitate to reach out.
